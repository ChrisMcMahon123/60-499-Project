# 60-499-Project
Creating Word map from source Text using the Qt framework

To create an application that will take in a large sample of text, parse it into words that have the highest frequency and arrange them inside a predefined image so that the words will be of different font sizes and leave as few empty spaces as possible

# Interface / Input / Requirements

•	Select Shape: from a few predefined shapes as well as well as the custom shape option.

•	Set Background Transparent: Sets the background of the produced image to transparent so it can easily be superimposed onto another image.

•	Background Colour: to let the user set an image as the background instead of a solid color.

•	Width/Height: Set the final dimensions of the produced Image to make it useful for differently sized screens.

•	Input Text: Just words which are defined as character sequences separated by 

# Output Options
Create a set of images to choose the best one among the produced images.

# Implementation: 
Language of your choice.

# Need to develop:

•	A parsing algorithm to process the raw text input.

• A placement algorithm to determine how the text will be placed within the image.

•	A padding algorithm to make sure large empty spaces are filled.

•	A library of predefined images that will be used for the purposes of creating the word map
